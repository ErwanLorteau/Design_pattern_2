== Code Simplification

=== Introduce Compose Method

The "Compose
Method"footnote:[http://c2.com/ppr/wiki/WikiPagesAboutRefactoring/ComposedMethod.html]
pattern is about producing methods that efficiently communicate what
they do and how they do what they do. According to Kent Beck:

[cite, Kent Beck]
____
«Divide your program into methods that perform one identifiable task.
Keep all of the operations in a method at the same level of abstraction.
This will naturally result in programs with many small methods, each a
few lines long.»
____

A Composed Method consists of calls to well-named methods that are all
at the same level of detail. 
Follow the instructions below to simplify
the method `add()` from class `ArrayList`:


.The ArrayList Class
[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/fr/rtp/util/ArrayList.java[]
----

The `ArrayList` class is composed of three parts:

<1> The _read only_ check part
<2> The grow part
<3> The actual add behavior part

==== Guard Clauses

[sidebar]
.To-Do
--
Invert the "readonly"  check to introduce a "Guard Clause".

[quote]
____
A guard clause is simply a check (the inverted `if`) that immediately exits the function, either with a `return` statement or an exception. Using guard clauses, the possible error cases are identified and there is the respective handling by returning or throwing an adequate exception.
____

TIP: For more information about Guard Clauses, read the refactoring https://refactoring.guru/fr/replace-nested-conditional-with-guard-clauses[Replace Nested Conditinal with Guard Clauses].
--

==== Extract Private Method

[sidebar]
.To-Do
--
Apply the _Extract Method_ refactoring operation to replace the two lines (18-19) that actually adds an element and create the private method `void addElement(Object obj)`.

TIP: To use the _Extract Method_ refactoring, first select le lines you want to place in a different method, then go to menu:Refactor[Extract/Introduce > Method...] and name the new method.
--

==== Replace Magic Numbers
.To-Do
[sidebar]
--
Apply the _Extract Constant_ refactoring operation to replace the magic number `10` and introduce an "Explanatory Variable" named `GROWTH_INCREMENT`.

[quote, Kent Beck]
____
Explanatory variables are variables with meaningful names, which held intermediate values of complex calculations to break them up.

The simple use of explanatory variables makes it clear that the first matched group is the key, and the second matched group is the value.
____

TIP: To use the _Extract Constant_ refactoring operation, first select the value (10), then go to menu:Refactor[Extract/Introduce > Constant...] and name the new constant.
--

==== Extract Private Method Again

[sidebar]
.To-Do
--
Apply the _Inline variable_ refactoring operation to `newSize` and then apply the _Extract
Method_ refactoring operation  to the code that checks whether the `element`  array is at its capacity and needs to grow, and create the method `atCapacity()`.

In other words, replace the boolean expression of the `if` statement by the call of `atCapacity()`.

TIP: To inline a variable, select its usage (not its definition) and go to menu:Refactor[Inline Variable]

--

==== Extract the `grow()` Method

[sidebar]
.To-Do
--
Finally, apply the __Extract Method__ operation to the part of the code that grows the size of the array, creating the `grow()` private method.
--

==== Final code

After applying all the previous refactoring operations, your code should look like:

[source,java]
----
public void add(Object child) {
    if (readOnly) {
        return;
    }
    if (atCapacity()) {
        grow();
    }
    addElement(child);
}
----

=== Replace Conditional Logic with Strategy

The https://naomod.univ-nantes.io/patterns/strategy.html[Strategy Design Pattern] defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and make them interchangeable, letting the algorithm vary independently of the clients that use it.

We can apply this pattern to classes where several methods have similar structure: a sequence of similar conditions.

For instance, let us consider the `Loan`
classfootnote:[http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1398607&seqNum=2],
from Joshua Kerievsky’s book <<rtp>>:

[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/fr/rtp/loan/Loan.java[]
----

This class deals with calculating capital for three different kinds of bank loans:

Term loan::
A loan from a bank for a specific amount that has a specified repayment schedule and a fixed or floating interest rate.
Revolver::
A credit that is automatically renewed as debts are paid off.
Advised line::
A credit that a financial institution approves and maintains for a customer.

Much of the logic of methods and deals with figuring out whether the loan is a term loan, a revolver, or an advised line.

For example, a `null` expiry date and a non-`null` maturity date indicate a term loan.
A `null` maturity and a non-`null` expiry date indicate a revolver loan.

In this exercise, we will use the Strategy Design Pattern to simplify the calculation of the loan’s capital.

==== Create the `CapitalStrategy` class

[sidebar]
.To-Do
--
. Create an empty class named `CapitalStrategy`.
. Add a field named `strategy` to class `Loan`.

[source, java]
.The empty `CapitalStrategy`class and its usage
----
public class CapitalStrategy {}
public class Loan {
    private CapitalStrategy strategy;
    // (...)
}
----
--



Now, apply the ``Move Method'' refactoring operation to move the method
to class . This involves:

. Changing the visibility of some private methods: , , , , and .
. Encapsulating fields , , , , , , and .
. Creating a simple version of method on class , which delegates to an
instance of .
. Moving the method and replacing all references to by .

* Maybe we should remember that "protected" methods are accessible from
classes belonging to the same package.

....
public class LoanRefactored {
    // (...)

    public double capital() {
        return new CapitalStrategy().capital(this);
    }
    // (...)
    protected double riskFactor() {
        return RiskFactor.getFactors().forRating(riskRating);
    }

    protected double unusedRiskFactor() {
        return UnusedRiskFactors.getFactors().forRating(riskRating);
    }

    protected double getUnusedPercentage() {
        return 0.0;
    }

    protected Date getMaturity() {
        return maturity;
    }

    protected Date getExpiry() {
        return expiry;
    }

    protected double getCommitment() {
        return commitment;
    }

    protected List<Payment> getPayments() {
        return payments;
    }
}

public class CapitalStrategy {
    public double capital(LoanRefactored loan) {
        if (loan.getExpiry() == null && loan.getMaturity() != null)
            return loan.getCommitment() * loan.duration() * loan.riskFactor();
        if (loan.getExpiry() != null && loan.getMaturity() == null) {
            if (loan.getUnusedPercentage() != 1.0)
                return loan.getCommitment() *loan.getUnusedPercentage() * loan.duration() * loan.riskFactor();
            else
                return (loan.outstandingRiskAmount() * loan.duration() * loan.riskFactor())
                        + (loan.unusedRiskAmount() * loan.duration() * loan.unusedRiskFactor());
        }
        return 0.0;
    }
}
....

Apply the ``Move Method'' refactoring operation again to move the method
to class .

....
public double duration(LoanRefactored loan) {
        if (loan.getExpiry() == null && loan.getMaturity() != null)
            return this.weightedAverageDuration(loan);
        else if (loan.getExpiry() != null && loan.getMaturity() == null)
            return loan.strategy.yearsTo(loan.getExpiry(), loan);
        return 0.0;
    }
....

Since some methods, such as , , , and are only used by method , we can
move them to class as well. The two constants, and can also be moved to
class .

* After these refactorings, the code should be:

[source,java]
----
----

[source,java]
----
----

Finally, apply the ``Replace Conditional with Polymorphism ''
refactoring operation on method method. First, create a subclass named
for the capital calculation for a term loan. Then, move and adapt
methods , , and to the subclass.

....
public class CapitalStrategyTermLoan extends CapitalStrategy {
   public double capital(Loan loan) {
      return loan.getCommitment() * duration(loan) * riskFactorFor(loan);
   }

   public double duration(Loan loan) {
      return weightedAverageDuration(loan);
   }

   private double weightedAverageDuration(Loan loan) {
      double duration = 0.0;
      double weightedAverage = 0.0;
      double sumOfPayments = 0.0;
      Iterator loanPayments = loan.getPayments().iterator();
      while (loanPayments.hasNext()) {
         Payment payment = (Payment)loanPayments.next();
         sumOfPayments += payment.amount();
         weightedAverage += yearsTo(payment.date(), loan) * payment.amount();
      }
      if (loan.getCommitment() != 0.0)
         duration = weightedAverage / sumOfPayments;
      return duration;
   }
....

In the end, class is abstract:

[source,java]
----
----

=== Chain Constructors

Classes may have several constructors: this is normal, as there may be
different ways to instantiate objects of a same class. However, when
there is duplicated code across two or more contacts, maintenance
problems arise.

Consider the three constructors of class  , presented in
Listing #lst:loan:constructors[[lst:loan:constructors]], which have
duplicated code. We will use the refactoring operation named ``Chain
Constructors'', whose goal is to remove duplication in constructors by
making them call each other.

First, we analyze these constructors to find out which one is the
``catch-all constructor'', the one that handles all of the construction
details. It seems that it should be constructor 3, since making
constructors 1 and 2 call 3 can be achieved with a minimum amount of
work.

....
public Loan(float notional, float outstanding, int rating, Date expiry) {
   this.strategy = new TermROC();
   this.notional = notional;
   this.outstanding = outstanding;
   this.rating = rating;
   this.expiry = expiry;
}

public Loan(float notional, float outstanding, int rating, Date expiry, Date maturity) {
   this.strategy = new RevolvingTermROC();
   this.notional = notional;
   this.outstanding = outstanding;
   this.rating = rating;
   this.expiry = expiry;
   this.maturity = maturity;
}

public Loan(CapitalStrategy strategy, float notional, float outstanding, int rating, Date expiry, Date maturity) {
   this.strategy = strategy;
   this.notional = notional;
   this.outstanding = outstanding;
   this.rating = rating;
   this.expiry = expiry;
   this.maturity = maturity;
}
....

Change constructor 1 to make it call constructor 3.

public Loan(float notional, float outstanding, int rating, Date expiry)
this(new TermROC(), notional, outstanding, rating, expiry, null);

Now, change constructor 2 to make it also call constructor 3.

public Loan(float notional, float outstanding, int rating, Date expiry,
Date maturity) this(new RevolvingTermROC(), notional, outstanding,
rating, expiry, maturity);

=== Replace Constructors with Creation Methods

The goal of the ``Replace Constructors with Creation Methods''
refactoring operation is to replace constructors with
intention-revealing creation methods that return object instances.

Creation methods have at least two advantages, that cannot be achieved
in Java. First, they can have different names and thus communicate
intention efficiently. Second, creation methods can have the same number
of parameters.

We will apply this refactoring to improve the constructions of class .
Consider another version of class , presented in
Listing #lst:load:constructors:bis[[lst:load:constructors:bis]].

....
public class Loan {

    double commitment;
    double outstanding;
    int riskRating;
    Date maturity;
    Date expiry;
    CapitalStrategy capitalStrategy;

    public Loan(double commitment, int riskRating, Date maturity) {
        this(commitment, 0.00, riskRating, maturity, null);
    }

    public Loan(double commitment, int riskRating, Date maturity, Date expiry) {
       this(commitment, 0.00, riskRating, maturity, expiry);
    }

    public Loan(double commitment, double outstanding, int riskRating, Date maturity, Date expiry) {
        this(null, commitment, outstanding, riskRating, maturity, expiry);
    }

    public Loan(CapitalStrategy capitalStrategy, double commitment, int riskRating, Date maturity, Date expiry) {
        this(capitalStrategy, commitment, 0.00, riskRating, maturity, expiry);
    }

    public Loan(CapitalStrategy capitalStrategy, double commitment, double outstanding, int riskRating, Date maturity,
            Date expiry) {
        this.commitment = commitment;
        this.outstanding = outstanding;
        this.riskRating = riskRating;
        this.maturity = maturity;
        this.expiry = expiry;
        this.capitalStrategy = capitalStrategy;

        if (capitalStrategy == null) {
            if (expiry == null)
                this.capitalStrategy = new CapitalStrategyTermLoan();
            else if (maturity == null)
                this.capitalStrategy = new CapitalStrategyRevolver();
            else
                this.capitalStrategy = new CapitalStrategyRCTL();
        }
    }
}
....

To apply this refactoring, we need to find a code that calls one of
these constructors. For instance, in a test case:

public class CapitalCalculationTests... public void
testTermLoanNoPayments() //... Loan termLoan = new Loan(commitment,
riskRating, maturity); //...

First, apply the ``Extract Method'' refactoring on that constructor call
to produce a public, static method called .

public class CapitalCalculationTests

public void testTermLoanNoPayments() //... Loan termLoan =
createTermLoan(commitment, riskRating, maturity); //...

public static Loan createTermLoan(double commitment, int riskRating,
Date maturity) return new Loan(commitment, riskRating, maturity);

Next, apply the ``Move Method'' refactoring on the creation method, , to
move it to .

public class Loan // ... public static Loan createTermLoan(double
commitment, int riskRating, Date maturity) return new Loan(commitment,
riskRating, maturity);

public class CapitalCalculationTest //... public void
testTermLoanNoPayments() // ... Loan termLoan =
Loan.createTermLoan(commitment, riskRating, maturity); //...

After doing that, we will need to find all callers of the constructor
and update them to call . Since now the method is now the only caller on
the constructor, we can apply the ``Inline Method'' refactoring to this
constructor.

public static Loan createTermLoan(double commitment, int riskRating,
Date maturity) return new Loan(commitment, 0.00, riskRating, maturity,
null);

Repeat the same procedure to the other constructors, to create
additional creation methods on class .

public static Loan newRevolver(double commitment, Date start, Date
expiry, int riskRating) return new Loan(commitment, 0, start, expiry,
null, riskRating, new CapitalStrategyRevolver());

public static Loan newAdvisedLine(double commitment, Date start, Date
expiry, int riskRating) if (riskRating > 3) return null; Loan
advisedLine = new Loan(commitment, 0, start, expiry, null, riskRating,
new CapitalStrategyAdvisedLine()); advisedLine.setUnusedPercentage(0.1);
return advisedLine;

Last step, since the constructors are only used by creation methods,
they can become private.

=== Replace State-Altering Conditionals with State

[source,java]
----
----

The context class is a class that contains the original state field, a
field that gets assigned to or compared against a family of constants
during state transitions. Apply _Replace Type Code with Class_ on the
original state field such that its type becomes a class. We’ll call that
new class the state superclass.

The context class is known as State: Context and the state superclass as
State: State in Design Patterns.

Class has a field called , which is of type String. The first step is to
change state’s type to be a class by applying the refactoring Replace
Type Code with Class. This yields the following new class:”

....
public class PermissionState {
    private String name;
    private PermissionState(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public final static PermissionState REQUESTED = new PermissionState("REQUESTED");
    public final static PermissionState CLAIMED = new PermissionState("CLAIMED");
    public final static PermissionState GRANTED = new PermissionState("GRANTED");
    public final static PermissionState DENIED = new PermissionState("DENIED");
    public final static PermissionState UNIX_REQUESTED = new PermissionState("UNIX_REQUESTED");
    public final static PermissionState UNIX_CLAIMED = new PermissionState("UNIX_CLAIMED");

    public String toString() {
        return name;
    }
}
....

image:TypeCodeWithClass.jpg[image]

Each constant in the state superclass now refers to an instance of the
state superclass. Apply Extract Subclass to produce one subclass (known
as State: ConcreteState) per constant, then update the constants in the
state superclass so that each refers to the correct subclass instance of
the state superclass. Finally, declare the state superclass to be
abstract.

PermissionState now contains six constants, all of which are instances
of PermissionState. To make each of these constants an instance of a
subclass of PermissionState, I apply Extract Subclass [F] six times to
produce the result shown in the following diagram. ``Because no client
will ever need to instantiate PermissionState, I declare it to be
abstract:''

....
public abstract class PermissionState...
....

image:extract-subclass.pdf[image]

Find a context class method that changes the value of the original state
field based on state transition logic. Copy this method to the state
superclass, making the simplest changes possible to make the new method
work. (A common, simple change is to pass the context class to the
method in order to have code call methods on the context class.).
Finally, replace the body of the context class method with a delegation
call to the new method.

Repeat this step for every context class method that changes the value
of the original state field based on state transition logic.

Next, I find a method on SystemPermission that changes the value of
permission based on state transition logic. There are three such methods
in SystemPermission: claimedBy(), deniedBy(), and grantedBy(). I start
by working with claimedBy(). I must copy this method to PermissionState,
making enough changes to get it to compile and then replacing the body
of the original claimedBy() method with a call to the new
PermissionState version:

Choose a state that the context class can enter, and identify which
state superclass methods make this state transition to other states.
Copy the identified method(s), if any, to the subclass associated with
the chosen state and remove all unrelated logic.

Unrelated logic usually includes verifications of a current state or
logic that transitions to unrelated states.

Repeat for all states the context class can enter.

“In PermissionState, I can now delete the bodies of claimedBy(),
deniedBy(), and grantedBy(), leaving the following:

abstract class PermissionState public String toString(); public void
claimedBy(SystemAdmin admin, SystemPermission permission) public void
deniedBy(SystemAdmin admin, SystemPermission permission) public void
grantedBy(SystemAdmin admin, SystemPermission permission)

Delete the bodies of each of the methods copied to the state superclass
during step 3 to produce an empty implementation for each method.
